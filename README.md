## Brief

Create a full-stack application with its own front end and back end. Use a Python Flask API with a REST framework to serve data from a Postgres database. Consume the API with a React front end. Create a complete product with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality. Implement thoughtful user stories and have a visually impressive design. Deploy online so it's publicly accessible.
