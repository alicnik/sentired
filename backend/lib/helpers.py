# Define function to calculate aggregate sentiment score for a user. Reduces all user_sentiments as held in
# user_sentiments join table to an overall sentiment score. Uses reduce to iterate through the user.user_sentiments list.
# sentiment_sum function is used in the reducer, if/else logic therein accounts for the different arguments that will be passed in
# depending on whether it is two Sentiment objects being added together, in which case the .score property is needed, or
# whether is it the reduce accumulator, which will be a float and therefore has no .score property.
# From resulting aggregate sentiment, update user's "emotion" property, which will be used on the front end for rending emotional UI.
